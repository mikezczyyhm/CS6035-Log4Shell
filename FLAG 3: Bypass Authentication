FLAG 3: Bypass Authentication (15 pts)
Make sure you have gone through the Setup and Intro sections.

If you haven’t already, run the start script in the home directory of log4j user, start the container with the start script:

  ./StartContainer.sh

Now that you have gotten familiar with this environment and exploit, let’s try for another, more involved flag. We will try exploiting another URI:

http://localhost:8080/rest/users/userlist

This endpoint will deliver a list of valid users a program can choose from. It uses a very weak form of authentication that verifies a user is permitted by validating their user id that they send through the “X-UserName” header field.

The goal here is to use your gatech id number in the “X-UserName” header (in addition to the GATECH_ID header) and have the application validate successfully. Example:

-H 'X-UserName:123456789'

First Run:

  curl 'http://localhost:8080/rest/users/userlist' -H 'GATECH_ID:123456789' -H 'Accept:application/json' -H   'X-UserName:rcoleman8'

and inspect the logged output. See if you can find anything that gives you a hint about how to exploit it/what you need to do to bypass the authentication.

Update Exploit.java to send a malicious payload that will bypass the endpoint’s validation by sending your gatech id in the ‘X-Username’ header. How you will bypass authentication can be found by analyzing the applications logged output. Follow the steps in the SETUP/INTRO section to run your exploit.

Upon success, you will see the output below, where the blacked out AuthorizedUsers is your UserId and your flag is right below it.. alt text

Hint: Someone might have tried to roll their own patch and tried to deny requests containing malicious string patterns.
*** **IF THIS FLAG COMES OUT BLANK, Restart container by running the stopContainer and startContainer scripts in the home directory of the log4j user. *****
